# HomeSphere Env Simulator

This Python script simulates a smart home environment with multiple rooms, generating random sensor data and sending it to a specified API endpoint. The simulation includes four rooms: Living Room, Dining and Kitchen Area, Bedroom, and Bathroom.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KenPrz/HomeSphere_2.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

3. Open the script in your preferred Python editor or IDE.

4. Update the API key in the script with your actual API key.

5. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python tester.py
    ```

## Configuration

- **API URL**: Set the `api_url` variable to the endpoint where you want to send the simulated data.

- **API Key**: Replace the placeholder `your_key_here` with your actual API key.

## Room Setup

- **Living Room**: Simulates random sensor data for the living room, including temperature, humidity, motion sensor, and gas levels.

- **Dining and Kitchen Area**: Simulates random sensor data for the dining and kitchen area, including temperature, humidity, motion sensor, and gas levels.

- **Bedroom**: Simulates random sensor data for the bedroom, including temperature, humidity, motion sensor, and gas levels.

- **Bathroom**: Simulates random sensor data for the bathroom, including temperature, humidity, motion sensor, and gas levels.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script according to your needs. You can adjust the sensor data ranges, add or remove devices, and modify the room setup.
